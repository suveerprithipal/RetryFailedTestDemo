# RetryFailedTestDemo

A quick and somewhat dirty demo of mkolisnyk cucumber retry logic. 
Essentially he has created a wrapper around the cucumber runner class which gives us the ability to rerun a failed scenario.
There are some noticeable bugs in the implementation but for all intended purposes his code works great. 

Thanks to mkolisnyk for your time and effort. 
You can find his work here: https://github.com/mkolisnyk/cucumber-reports

As a side note,
I take no credit for his work and have not contributed to this piece.
I merely have created a demonstration on how to use his implementation.
